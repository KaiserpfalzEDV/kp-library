/**
 * <p>EAN -- This medium has an EAN assigned.</p>
 *
 * <p>The International Article Number (also known as European Article Number or EAN) is a standard describing a barcode
 * symbology and numbering system used in global trade to identify a specific retail product type, in a specific
 * packaging configuration, from a specific manufacturer. The standard has been subsumed in the Global Trade Item Number
 * standard from the GS1 organization; the same numbers can be referred to as GTINs and can be encoded in other barcode
 * symbologies defined by GS1. EAN barcodes are used worldwide for lookup at retail point of sale, but can also be used
 * as numbers for other purposes such as wholesale ordering or accounting. These barcodes only represent the digits 0â€“9,
 * unlike some other barcode symbologies which can represent additional characters.</p>
 *
 * <p>The most commonly used EAN standard is the thirteen-digit EAN-13, a superset of the original 12-digit Universal
 * Product Code (UPC-A) standard developed in 1970 by George J. Laurer. An EAN-13 number includes a 3-digit GS1 prefix
 * (indicating country of registration or special type of product). A prefix with a first digit of "0" indicates a
 * 12-digit UPC-A code follows. A prefix with first two digits of "45" or "49" indicates a Japanese Article Number (JAN)
 * follows.</p>
